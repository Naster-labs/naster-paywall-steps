# Third-Party Licenses

This directory contains inventories of open-source components used by this project.

## Files

- `dependencies.json` — full machine-readable report generated by `license-checker` (includes package names, versions, and local license file paths).
- `dependencies.txt` — a human-readable Markdown table listing packages and their licenses.
- Optional `*-LICENSE.txt` — full license texts for custom or attribution-heavy components (e.g., “Custom”, “CC-BY”).

## How to Reproduce

From the repository root:

```bash
# 1) Generate the raw JSON inventory
npm run licenses:scan

# 2) Produce the pretty table and the summary NOTICE
npm run licenses:post

# One-shot:
npm run licenses:generate
```

If you only need runtime (production) dependencies, pass `--production` to `license-checker`
and store the output separately (e.g., `dependencies.prod.json`).

## Attribution & NOTICE

- Required attributions (e.g., **CC-BY**) and special conditions are summarized in the root-level [`NOTICE-3RD-PARTY.txt`](../NOTICE-3RD-PARTY.txt).
- For custom licenses, also include the full license text in this folder as `*-LICENSE.txt`.

## Release Checklist

1. Regenerate the inventories (`npm run licenses:generate`).
2. Review non-standard licenses: `UNLICENSED`, `Custom`, `LGPL`, `CC-BY`, `GPL` (if disallowed).
3. Update `NOTICE-3RD-PARTY.txt` if any attribution-required packages were added.
4. Commit changes.
